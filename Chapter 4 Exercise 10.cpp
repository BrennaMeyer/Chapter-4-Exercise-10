//Days in a Month
//Write a program that asks the user to enter the month(letting the user enter an integer in the range of 1 through 12) and the year.
// The program should then display the number of days in that month.Use the following criteria to identify leap years :

//Determine whether the year is divisible by 100. If it is, then it is a leap year if and only if it is divisible by 400. 
// For example, 2000 is a leap year but 2100 is not.
//If the year is not divisible by 100, then it is a leap year if and only if it is divisible by 4. For example,
// 2008 is a leap year but 2009 is not.

//Here is a sample run of the program :
//Enter a month(1–12) : 2 Enter
//Enter a year : 2008 Enter
//29 days

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello World!\n";
